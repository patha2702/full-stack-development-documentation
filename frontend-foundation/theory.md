## DOM (Document Object Model)
1. Document: The Document refers to the web page or document loaded in the browser, which is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or XML (Extensible Markup Language). It represents the entire structure of the web page, including elements such as <html>, <head>, <body>, and their contents.

2. Object: The Object aspect of the DOM refers to the individual nodes that make up the document. These nodes form a tree-like structure known as the DOM tree. Each node represents an element, attribute, or piece of text in the document. These nodes are represented as objects in programming languages like JavaScript, with properties and methods that can be accessed and manipulated.

3. Model: The Model in the DOM context refers to the abstract, structured representation of the document provided by the DOM. It serves as a model or interface for accessing and manipulating the content, structure, and style of the document programmatically. The DOM provides a consistent way to interact with web documents regardless of the underlying markup language. It allows developers to dynamically update the document, change styles, handle events, and more using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provided by the DOM.
